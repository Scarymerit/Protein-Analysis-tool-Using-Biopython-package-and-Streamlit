OverviewThis pipeline takes a raw PDB file (Protein Data Bank) as input and automatically performs a full bioinformatic analysis. It bridges the gap between structural biology and sequence analysis by extracting sequences directly from 3D models and mapping conserved motifs back onto the 3D structure.Perfect for: Bioinformatics students, Structural Biologists, and Researchers needing quick visualization of protein families.✨ Key Features📥 PDB Extraction: Automatically extracts peptide sequences from PDB structure files.Aignment (MSA): Performs Reference-based Multiple Sequence Alignment using global pairwise alignment.🔍 Motif Discovery:Generates WebLogo visualizations.Identifies conserved residues across chains.Plots motif frequency.🌳 Phylogenetics: Constructs and saves UPGMA and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees (Newick + PNG format).🧪 3D Visualization:Motif Mapping: Highlights conserved motifs in Red on the 3D structure.Hydrophobicity: Highlights hydrophobic residues (A, I, L, M, F, W, V) in Orange.📊 Database Fetching: (Optional) Fetches metadata from GenBank and SwissProt.⚙️ InstallationTo run this pipeline, you need Python installed along with the following libraries.1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/protein-analysis-pipeline.git
cd protein-analysis-pipeline
2. Install DependenciesRun the following command to install the required Python packages:Bashpip install biopython nglview matplotlib ipywidgets requests
Note for JupyterLab users: You may need to enable the nglview extension:jupyter-labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager nglview-js-widgets🚀 How to RunOption A: Google Colab (Recommended)This script is optimized for Google Colab (it uses google.colab file uploaders).Open the notebook in Google Colab.Run the cells.When prompted, click "Choose Files" to upload your .pdb file.Option B: Local MachineIf running locally, remove the from google.colab import files block inside the upload_pdb function and replace it with a standard input path (e.g., pdb_file = "my_protein.pdb").Run the script:Bashpython protein_pipeline.py
📂 Output & ResultsThe script creates a results/ folder containing the following:File NameDescriptionmotif_logo.pngA sequence logo showing the most common amino acids at each position.upgma_tree.pngImage of the phylogenetic tree (UPGMA method).nj_tree.pngImage of the phylogenetic tree (Neighbor-Joining method).*.newickTree files compatible with external viewers (like iTOL or FigTree).Interactive ViewsThe script will display interactive 3D widgets directly in your notebook:Select Chain: Choose a specific protein chain to see where the conserved motifs are located in 3D space.🧠 How It Works (The Pipeline)Input: User uploads a .pdb file.Extraction: The script breaks the PDB into individual peptide chains.Alignment: It finds the longest chain and aligns all others to it.Analysis: It calculates distance matrices and builds evolutionary trees.Visualization: It maps the sequence data back onto the 3D coordinates using NGLView.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
